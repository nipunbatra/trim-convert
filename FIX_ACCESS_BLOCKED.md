## üéØ What This Does:

- **Puts your app in "testing" mode** - bypasses Google verification
- **Adds you as a test user** - allows you to use the app
- **Works immediately** - no waiting for Google approval

---

## üîÑ Now Try Again:

1. **Run your video trimmer app**
2. **Sign in process should work** - no more access blocked error
3. **You'll see a warning** saying "This app isn't verified" - click **"Advanced"** ‚Üí **"Go to Video Trimmer (unsafe)"**
4. **Grant permissions** and you're done!

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Note:

- The "unsafe" warning is just because Google hasn't verified the app
- **It's perfectly safe** since you created the app yourself
- This is normal for personal/development apps
- All your data stays private and secure

**This fix works for personal use and testing. For public apps, you'd need Google verification, but that's not needed here!**
